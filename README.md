Program and demonstrate distributed system using RMI.
The student is required to build a distributed file system using client-server communication and Remote Method Invocation (RMI). The features of the file system should include but are not limited to:
• The server can log any activity with a timestamp.
• Any client can retrieve the activity log.
• Any client can upload a file to the server.
• Any client can request a list of files stored on the server.
• Any client can check the information of a file stored on the server. (e.g., size, type, etc.)
• Any client can download a file stored on the server.
• Any client can delete a file stored on the server.
Students should submit source code and executables in a ZIP file with README and record a video of not more than 10 minutes to demonstrate the working of the distributed file system with verbal explanations.
The demonstration baseline should consist of at least ONE server and a minimum of TWO clients. The file system should be able to cater to synchronization and concurrency issues.
